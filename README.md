## Initial Problem

I lost my keys the other day and can't get into my apartment

## Current Problem

UCLA IEEE, the electrical engineering club on campus, has a lab in which there are parts available and many projects being worked on all the time by its members. However, the lab is only open when officers are in the lab for assistance, which is just about 24/7. The only problem is that because as engineers we are night dwellers, the lab is not consistently open in the morning and therefore its hard to tell if its okay to come in. Therefore this script is being moded to use to tell if officers are in the lab.

## Solution

Use MAC addresses given to me from router to tell me who is home to let me in so I only need to ask exactly who is available to let me in to open the door.

## Future Features

1. Statistics on who is in the lab 
2. Building suggested times to catch a person in the lab using the statistics each quarter

### TODO:
1. Converting the script to python for portability (and because I like learning Python)
